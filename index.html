                <p>I am a student at George Brown College in the Interaction Design program. I previously attended Humber College’s <i>Fitness and Health Promotion</i> program where I began personal training.</p>
                <p>I decided to pursue a career in design because it’s something I’ve always had a passion for. Growing up I enjoyed drawing and sketching out ideas and as I got older that passion switched to photography and designing in software.</p>

            <h2 class="invert">Interests</h2>
            <h3>Sports / Fitness</h3>
            <p>I enjoy playing and watching a variety of sports. My top three are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Basketball</li>
                <li>Soccer</li>
                <li>Football</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I grew up playing competitive soccer all throughout elementary school and high school. In high school I played basketball and ran track & field. This is what sparked my interest in fitness as I got older and ultimately lead me to Humber College, and then into personal training. I enjoy being able to help others life a healthy and active life while accomplishing their fitness goals. Although it can be challenging at times the end results are often rewarding.</p>
            
            <h3>Music</h3>
            <p>I also enjoy music, both playing and listening. I play the <strong>drums</strong> and <strong>piano/keyboard</strong> and I’m working on learning how to play the bass guitar. I enjoy listening to Gospel, Jazz and R&B but generally listen to a variety of genres.</p>
            <p>A few of my favourite musicians are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
